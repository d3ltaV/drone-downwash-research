            <p>Two-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (Table 2) detected significant effects of height (p = 0.034), canopy position (p = 0.023), and their interaction (p = 0.038) on coverage rate, as well as significant impacts of height on both coverage density (p = 0.008) and droplet count (p = 0.008). Post-hoc Tukey Honestly Significant Difference tests (Table 3) indicated that the 15 ft flight height had significantly higher coverage rate and coverage density than the 5ft flight height (p = 0.006), with a notable near-significant result for coverage rate between the top and bottom canopy positions (p = 0.051).
                In all drone flight trials, the 5 ft trial received the lowest deposition in all metrics (droplet count, droplet density, and coverage rate) across all canopy layers. In the 10 ft flight trial, it had the highest mean coverage rate at 1.86% (Figure 8), while its droplet count and density values were intermediate relative to the 5 ft and 15 ft trials.  
                One-way ANOVA performed on the Backpack Sprayer trial (Table 1) shows that canopy position only significantly impacted coverage rate, but not coverage density or droplet count.

            <p>By tracking 100 leaf corners with the motion quantification software, 
                we determined that in a 3.10 s video taken during a drone fly-over at 10 ft, there was a total of 3902 cm of motion.

            <p>
               All drone trials showed a similar trend: the 5 ft flight height produced the lowest mean values across all three metrics (droplet count, coverage rate, and coverage density). 
               Coverage rate—identified as the most relevant metric for assessing deposition efficacy—showed a pronounced increase at 10 ft compared to the 5 ft and 15 ft trials, particularly 
               at the top of the canopy (Tukey HSD p = 0.051; Table 3). This suggests that 10 ft achieved the greatest overall deposition, though with less uniformity than the 15 ft treatment.

               The backpack sprayer trials exhibited a markedly higher mean coverage rate (maximum ≈ 25%) compared to the drone-based treatments (≈ 1.75%), likely due to the heavier spray pattern 
               and larger droplet sizes characteristic of manual application. Coverage within these trials was strongly concentrated in the upper canopy (Figure 12) with a statistically significant 
               difference between the top and bottom canopy positions.

               Based on the elevated coverage rate observed at 10 ft, the optimal flight altitude likely falls between 5 ft and 15 ft above the crop canopy. Because only three altitudes were 
               evaluated, additional trials are needed to refine this estimate. A significant interaction between flight height and canopy position for coverage rate (p = 0.038) further supports 
               that spray distribution is strongly dependent on both UAV altitude and canopy structure. Furthermore, drone downwash indeed created leaf motion, with a total of 3909 cm of movement 
               across 100 points in 3.1 seconds of video, leading each tracked leaf to move approximately 12.59 cm/s. This is significantly higher than the average leaf motion of 2.77 cm/s in the 
               ambient video. This motion caused by drone downwash led to more exposure to leaf surfaces in deeper levels of the canopy, as coverage rate was more uniform across layers.
